# recursion

This repository is created for practicing recursion with examples like the Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort.

## Files

### 1. `fibonacci.js`
- Includes a recursive function `fibsRec` that returns a Fibonacci sequence array based on the specified number.

### 2. `merge-sort.js`
- Implements the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion.
- Includs a `mergeSort` function that sorts an array by dividing it into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and merging the sorted subarrays back together.
